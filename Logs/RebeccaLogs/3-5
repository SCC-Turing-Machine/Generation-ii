5pm-7pm

Worked with Taylor and Aeone to set up the machine that unfortunaly fell apart during transportation to my apartment.
We were thinknig about using a sonic sensor instead of a light sensor since Mark(gen-i) had issues with it. I would have to look
at how it reads since it looks like it has different input/output, found a video with some of the lego coding for the ev3 on the
sensor.(Put link in the media folder)
