First official meeting to be logged*
Discussed timelines for the end of the quarter, Johns will be out of town during the Spring Break but will have email access
Decided best time to reach out to Mark Bennet will be a Friday during Spring Break
Johns suggested we focus our research on creative or conventional ways for a 'varafication' or 'hand shaking' process that might allow our machine to communicate back to the user that the task it 'says' it has completed has INDEED been completed. 
This is the next step in increasing the accuracy of the machine
